# hftlsql Flash Plugin


## Known bugs

* SOAP call returns answer from last test; how do I see the results of previous test runs?
--> store all results (each pass result is a triple; overall result is a merged array of 3xn passes)

* update of flash applet in ILIAS test --> use DIFFERENT filename (upload of file with the same name does not update the applet)
